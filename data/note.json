Ms. Nikolaus, being a responsible citizen and patient, utilizes English as her medium of communication. She is comfortable with English (United States) and prefers it for her medical conversations and interactions.\n\nRecently, on May 4th 2014, Ms. Nikolaus came into our clinic for a routine checkup. The lab results indicated a Urea Nitrogen concentration of 19.69 mg/dL in her blood. This result came to our attention at exactly 23:22:05, considering the timezone of +02:00. The report was released the very same day and the same time at 23:22:05.170.\n\nTo clarify, Urea Nitrogen [Mass/volume] in blood represents the amount of nitrogen in blood that comes from the body's natural breakdown of protein into amino acids and then ammonia which is eventually processed in the liver to create urea. The detected amount of Urea Nitrogen is within the normal range. However, the status of this observation remains unknown, which means we are yet to infer any concrete medical sutuations.\n\nThis is all the medical and personal information we have documented for Ms. Nikolaus.

Importantly, Carlos didn't have the characterstic of being one of a multiple birth. Furthermore, an examination review reveals an allergy intolerance marked with mild severity, although the specifics of the allergy were unfortunately not documented, which surely warrants future exploration should further need arise.\n\nNow coming to his clinical observations, there were two significant observations documented. Firstly, the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 item (often shorten as PHQ-2), which is a renowned tool for assessing mental health, was conducted for Carlos. It is regrettable that the status of this test is unknown, but it is recorded that he scored a value of 5. Its implications need be carefully interpreted by mental health professionals, considering the person's history and context.\n\nSecondly, the MCHC (Mean Cell Haemoglobin Concentration) observation which is usually integral for evaluating anemias, has been performed. However, the status of this test result too, is unclear. But, this test was conducted on the 22nd of May, 2001 at 09:12:27, Central European Summer Time, and the result was made known at the same date and time.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the lack of certain data, it is hoped that this compilation of Mr. Carlos Howe's medical history and observations will prove helpful and assistive for any future clinical investigations and recallings. Medical team are advised to revisit the mentioned allergy intolerance for a more comprehensive understanding of Mr. Howe's health status. It is also recommended that the unknown statuses for both PHQ-2 and MCHC are duly investigated and resolved.

Interestingly, Ms. Nitzsche can communicate in Korean, a bit of a surprise given she's residing in the States.\n\nOn another note, she's turned up for her regular immunizations as recommended by medical standards, and I must commend her punctuality. On December 25, 2021, at exactly 8:47:51 AM in the local timezone, Ms. Nitzsche successfully received a dose of the live zoster vaccine. This record indicates she's conscious of her health and isn't taking chances with preventable diseases like shingles, which the zoster vaccine helps guard against. \n\nThat's pretty much the critical information for now, and it seems the measures for maintaining good health are already well underway for Ms. Nitzsche. One can only hope she sticks to the plans.\n\n\n"},{"record_id":1811,"note":"Clinical Note:\n\n- Patient Name: Ena Toi Herman\n- Gender: Female\n- Marital Status: Never Married\n- Has multiple birth siblings: No\n\nEncounters:\n- Ena Toi Herman had a medical encounter of an unknown status at a medical facility, which could not be specified with a start and end time.
